<p>
Hello, all.  This is Leo.  You might remember me from the heat
transfer portion of CP204.  This semester I will be delivering the
fifth year module CP535: Molecular and Interfacial Science.
</p>

<p>
In this module, we will be covering the fundamentals of phenomena at
interfaces and the processes that occur at the molecular level.  The
aim will be to understand the properties and behavior of materials,
their microscopic origins, and how these can be exploited in
applications.
</p>






<p>
The module will officially start on Monday September 23.  The MyPlace site is still under construction, so I will be modifying and adding material during the next few weeks.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions, please feel free to post them in the discussion forum, and I will be happy to address them.

</p>

<p>
There are a lot of innovations and breakthroughs being made in
materials science and nanotechnology, which have the potential to
radically change many aspects of chemical engineering, such as in
process monitoring, chemical synthesis, and energy storage and
harvesting.
</p>

<p>
One of these advances is the field of digital microfluidics, where
innovations in the miniaturization of electronics can be used to
develop devices where we can precisely coordinate the movement of
small droplets of solutions.  This allows us to transport, mix, react,
or analyze solutions.  This has tremendous potential for applications,
such as in developing a lab-on-a-chip, small on-demand microreactors,
or blood analysis devices.
</p>

<p>
In this module we will gain a better understanding of the electronic
properties of materials and how these can be exploited in
applications, such as for the development of light emitting diodes and
photovoltaic cells.  This will also allow us to understand the basic
working principles behind the creation of self-cleaning surfaces, the
use of sunlight to catalyze reactions such as the splitting of water
into hydrogen and oxygen, and the analysis and manipulation of
chemistry at the molecule level.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, this module will allow you to better relate these
technologies and their implications to your particular interests.
Perhaps, you might be able to incorporate some of these innovations in
your work or possibly even invent and develop your own technologies
based on these ideas.

<p>
The main topics that will be covered in the module can be divided into four main sections: (i) interfacial science, (ii) microscopic dynamics, (iii) statistical mechanics, and (iv) the electronic properties of materials.
</p>

<p>
Within the interfacial science section of the module, we will discuss how the surface tension of a material originates from the interactions between its constituent molecules.  We will then consider some of the consequences of surface tension, such as dictating the shapes of droplets, the wetting of solid surfaces by liquid drops, capillary forces, and bridging forces.  As part of this, we will also go into a bit of depth on the mathematical description of surfaces and interfaces.
</p>

<p>
Next, we will turn our attention to the dynamics of systems at the microscopic scale.  We will briefly review classical mechanics and introduce some concepts of how we characterize the microscopic state of a systems.  This will then take us to a basic introduction to quantum mechanics.
</p>

<p>
Statistical mechanics provides a connection between microscopic interactions between the molecules that make up a system and its macroscopic behavior, such as its thermodynamic properties.  We will go through some simple examples, including deriving the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution, examining ideal gases, and the studying the adsorption of gases onto surfaces.
</p>

<p>
The final topic applies the basic quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics we learned previously to examine the electronic properties of materials and the use of these properties in applications, such as the creation of LEDs and solar cells and in catalysis.

<p>
I will be the lecturer for this module, and Chris Boyle will be the
demonstrator.
</p>

<p>
Lectures and question &amp; answer sessions will be held live on Zoom on
Tuesdays from 3.00 to 4.00 pm and on Fridays from 11.00 to 12.00 pm.
The Tuesday sessions will mainly be devoted to covering new material,
while the Friday sessions will be mainly to review material from the
past week or earlier and to provide help on any coursework problems or
to answer any questions about the module.  Its format will be mainly
informal and flexible.
</p>

<p>
Tutorial sessions will run every week on Tuesdays from 4.00 to 5.00 pm
following on straight after the lectures.  There will be two main
pieces of coursework for this module, which I will discuss in more
detail later when I cover assessment.  The tutorial sessions are there
for you to get help in working through the coursework.
</p>

<p>
Finally, in the last teaching week of the semester (i.e. week 11), the
lecture and tutorial sessions will be used to provide a review for
module material and preparation for the final examination.

<p>
A tentative schedule of the lecture materials is shown here.
</p>

<p>
In week 1 we will cover surfaces and interfaces, and in week 2 we will
look more closely at the interfaces between solids and liquids and
gases.
</p>

<p>
In week 3 we cover microscopic dynamics, briefly reviewing classical
mechanics and then getting a basic introduction to quantum mechanics.
</p>

<p>
In week 4 we will start into statistical mechanics and we will look at
an example of its application in week 5 to ideal gases and kinetic
theory.  In week 6, we will look at its specific application to
adsorption, and then in week 7 we will apply statistical mechanics to
quantum systems.  This will then lead us into week 8, where we will
look at the electronic properties of materials, and from there in week
9 we will look at electronic devices like LEDs, photovoltaic cells,
and other devices, if time allows, such as transistors and vacuum
tubes.  Then finally in week 10 we will look at the application of
these concepts into catalysis, specifically electrocatalysis and
photocatalysis.
</p>

<p>
The final week is reserved for a review of the module material and
preparation for the exam.

<p>
There are three main elements of assessment.  The first is the final
exam, which is worth 70% of the overall marks in the module.  The exam
paper will consist of three questions that cover aspects of the entire
content of the module.  We will discuss more details of the exam
during the final week of the semester.
</p>

<p>
There will be two pieces of coursework, one to be submitted on MyPlace
at the end of week 5 and the other at the end of week 10.  Each is
worth 15% of the overall marks in the module.  After each piece of
course work is submitted, fully worked solutions will be released.
These are peer assessed, but the marking will be moderated by myself.
You will need to mark 3 other assignments within one week of the
submission date.  80% of the coursework marks is for the performance
on answering the questions, while 20% is for marking of the questions.
</p>

<p>
You can work together with other students to complete the coursework,
but your final submissions should be your own work.  The tutorial
sessions should be used to ask questions if you are having troubles.
The exam questions will be of a similar style and level of difficulty.

<p>
In this module, we will be applying a lot of the chemical engineering
principles that you learned in the previous years to the molecular
scale.  The main focus and illustrative examples that you have
encountered on the course so far have mainly been on "macroscopic"
systems.  In this module, we will be applying balances, kinetics,
statistics, etc. to examine interfaces, molecules, and even electrons.
