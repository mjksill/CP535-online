Hello, all.  This is Leo.  You might remember me from the heat
transfer portion of CP204.  This semester I will be delivering the
fifth year module CP535: Molecular and Interfacial Science.
</p>

<p>
In this module, we will be covering the fundamentals of phenomena at
interfaces and the processes that occur at the molecular level.  The
aim will be to understand the properties and behavior of materials,
their microscopic origins, and how these can be exploited in
applications.

<p>
I am the lecturer for this module, and Chris Boyle will be the
demonstrator.
</p>

<p>
Lectures and question &amp; answer sessions will be held live on Zoom on
Tuesdays from 2.00 to 3.00 pm and on Fridays from 12.00 to 1.00 pm.
The Tuesday sessions will mainly be devoted to covering new material,
while the Friday sessions will be mainly to review material from the
past week or earlier and to provide help on any coursework problems or
to answer any questions about the module.  Its format will be mainly
informal and flexible.
</p>

<p>
Tutorial sessions will run every week on Tuesdays from 4.00 to 5.00 pm
following on straight after the lectures.  There will be two main
pieces of coursework for this module, which I will discuss in more
detail later when I cover assessment.  The tutorial sessions are there
for you to get help in working through the coursework.
</p>

<p>
Finally, in the last teaching week of the semester (i.e. week 11), the
lecture and tutorial sessions will be used to provide a review for
module material and preparation for the final examination.

In this module, we will be applying a lot of the chemical engineering
principles that you learned in the previous years to the molecular
scale.  The main focus and illustrative examples that you have
encountered on the course has been on "macroscopic" systems.  We will
be applying balances, kinetics, statistics, etc. to examine
interfaces, molecules, and even electrons.

So what can you do
with the interfacial science?  You kind of understand a little bit
about contact angles and kind of. Surface tension, interfacial
tension, and all that but one of the things you know. So as creative
as you are, you can actually come up with really cool things just by
using these very basic principles.

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
This video is an example from a field known as digital microfluidics.
</p>

<p>
Miniaturization has had a huge impact on fields such as mechanical
engineering and electrical engineering.  There are a large number of
things that people hobbyists have done.
</p>

<p>
Within mechanical and electrical engineering, if you wanted to build a
little robot or you know those kind of things, you have Lego kits, you
have Raspberry Pi's you have, little electronic devices that you can
hook together and do as a hobbyist. 
</p>

<p>
But one of the things I think is is kind of missing in chemical
engineering.  Is that there is this sort of that aspect is not kind of
present in chemical engineering, you know, so they have 3D printing,
which you think of more as mechanical or or you think of. You know a
robot is more more, let's say electrical or sensors as more
electrical, but if you but one of the things is, like you know, can we
as Chemical Engineers 3D print little pumps have that run
characterized at or even use electronics to do certain things?
</p>

<p>
The video here shows a device that is on the centimeter scale.  And
what they're doing is they're actually, you know, with with sort of
electronics fabrication.  What they're doing is they're changing the
voltage on the actual surface is of those plates. And they are able
to. Well, let me just click on that the video again. So maybe just
rewind on the bottom left.
</p>

<p>
They are changing the voltages on each of those little plates so they
can individually control the voltage is OK, and by doing so the
contact angle the droplet makes with the plate changes, which causes
it to be. dragged into the next plate, and so they can at will move
little droplets of samples get him to to kind of come together, mix
them, get them to react, and then move him to another location to
maybe do another form of analysis. Let's say they can analyze it using
with, for example, some kind of spectroscopic technique or some other
thing.
</p>

<p>
So this is a device where chemical engineering meets electronics and
interfacial science. So you can already buy these things. Little kind
of hobbyist kits for this kind of equipment. Uh, on the Internet and
then if you're interested, just send me an email. I could tell you I
could show you some of the links. I think it's something around 100
pounds or something like that, but you can just get like a little kind
of kit like this to just play around with it and program it.  So this
is one of the big areas digital microfluidics, and we'll kind of get
an understanding of that from this sort of interfacial science.

</p>

<p>
Another application of being able to manipulate 
interfacial properties is liquid lenses.
</p>

<p>
So one of the few moving parts on
your phone. Is actually the camera lens and that kind of limits the
amount you can zoom in and out is how far you can move these pieces
back together.  You know forward and back.
</p>

<p>
But one of the ways that you can kind of get rid of this moving
pieces. Actually, if you use interfacial tension.  So if you have like
let's say oil lens and a water interface so you have oil and water and
again what you're doing is you're putting an electrical voltage on
this interface and it's changing the wedding angle from where it sort
of likes to wet to where it doesn't like to with the oil to wet the
surface.
</p>

<p>
And in doing that, you're actually changing the curvature of the oil
water interface, and that actually changes where the focus is and
where you can actually bend things. So now you can actually form. You
could have cameras that are automatically focusing without, and you
know that are responding very very quickly without any moving
parts. And you can imagine you know situations where you may or may
not want to do these kind of things.  But again, it's just nothing
more than an issue of, like interfacial tension and contact angles.

<p>
Another thing you could think of is actually eating, so I don't know
if you've kind of familiar with these are a little bit different than
sort of the LED or LCD displays. These are actually kind of things
that actually take passive light, and they bounce off the surface.
But again, by changing the wedding, by the way, these sort of inks, we
have a black ink in a white ink. They could actually have different
kind of affinity's two electrical charge. So if you change the
electrical charge on, you know of these sort of little pixels that are
there with a little colloids that are dissolved in these in these
droplets.
</p>

<p>
Then you can actually.  Change what you perceive as the colour
there. So like in in the left you know tops top picture left, left
side. You'll see that actually the droplet will appear black from
where what you see from above? Where is it will appear grey in in the
right half. People are also playing around with colors, so you can
even have the bottom kind of picture. You can have a colored ink in in
sort of a bunch of these little pixels. And by putting a voltage in so
when it's not, let's say when there's no voltage on it, it will be
fully spread and it'll fully wet the surface and what you'll see is
just a red pixel. But if you kind of put a voltage on it, it can
actually be pulled away in hidden and it will. You know it won't want
to wet the whole surface and it'll have varying degrees of redness on
that particular pixel. Depending on what you want to do.

And then the common thing you know this is the big thing. Can we kind

we're going to learn a little bit about the principles of
photovoltaics, sort of how they actually work, and we're going to try
to learn enough about that to try to be able to model that to some
extent and understand the basic working principles so we can sort of
see what you know. What can be done and why, is it you know why. Why
these things aren't that prevalent and what and how we can make them
sort of more, more prevalent in what we do?

<p>
The other thing we were going to be looking at a little bit if we have
time is energy harvesting.  So there are materials called
piezoelectrics. I don't know how much you guys know about this, but
they are the kind of things that are used for stress measurements. So
actually if you have a bathroom scale nowadays or or. Some of these
things what happens is that there are materials that, when you squeeze
them, or you press on them, or you stretch them, they actually output
a voltage. And so when the output voltage, the voltage depends on how
much stress you put on them and that's and what they do is they
translate that signal. That that sort of voltage signal 2A force. OK
so you calibrate in some way. So when your bathroom scale you stand on
it. You actually put a stress on it on this sort of piezo electric. It
registers a voltage and depending on how big that voltages, you
translate that into the reading on the scale.  So things go. So one
way what you can do is you can just measure that voltage, but what you
can also do is you can actually try to develop materials that actually
are piezo electric but are very thin and you can weave them into
different fabrics. And now what you're trying to do?  As you're trying
to, instead of just sort of using that signal and so leaving it,
you're trying to kind of capture it like a little bit of like a a
little bit of a ratchet, so you're trying to capture those sort of
voltages or this little small currents and then put them into a, store
them into a battery or something in order to to use later. So hope to
and this is a way that you can try to use sort of waste motion or
waste, kind of Stretching or shrinking in order to get energy. So I
think people do have these kind of things. You know they were.
</p>

<p>
They have prototypes that they put under sidewalks or things like
that. Or they'll put on clothing or they'll put in the backpack.
</p>

<p>
But these are just sort of ideas of one of the things that you can try
to do with this idea of of a material that.  Gives an electrical
signal.  Because when you actually apply a stress. Also, the other
kind of backwards in anything that you go that you can do forward.  So
if you put a stress that causes a voltage. Anything that you put
forward, you can always run backwards, right? If you haven't yet, if
you try to get you put in heat to get work.  You can always run that
principle backwards, put in work to remove heat, right? So you can an
engine can be used as a refrigeration unit, right? Same thing with
this piezos. You put a stress in to try to get a voltage. The other
way people use these piezo materials is they actually put in a voltage
and this thing will. Actually this material get stressed. So then what
that means is that you can actually. This is how these little kind of
some of these motion things are done. So you can actually move little
kind of robots or little mechanisms by putting voltages and finally
control the motion of certain things.

<p>
Um, yeah. And so one of the examples that you can do with that. So not
only can you kind of determine the characteristics of a surface like
you know where, where molecules are absorbed or what the topology of a
surface is. If there are any defects or whatnot, you can literally
just you can actually do chemical reactions for molecules, adsorb down
to the surface. So essentially what you're doing is that you're sort
of injecting or pulling away electrons by changing the voltage on that
tip, so you bring that into the surface.
</p>

<p>
You can actually increase its electrical potential, which means that
it's going to try to drag electrons away from.  Away from the the the
actual molecule, and So what you're doing sort of in chemical terms,
is that your oxidizing the molecule right. And if you move that tip
away and then you try to put a voltage on it such that it is a lower
voltage than what's on the molecule.
</p>

<p>
Then what you're trying to do is, you're trying to. You're going to
try to push that electron onto the molecule, and again, in chemical
terms, that sort of reducing the molecule so you can have sort of
molecules form radicals with that.
</p>

<p>
And then get it to work with the carrier gas. Or you can specifically
kind of cause chemical reactions to occur at will. On the surface.

Uh, I think yeah, maybe just have a play with this. This is just
a. Yeah, go ahead and play that. So this is just a video that actually
the different pixels are actually atoms, and
so they're actually able to move
individual atoms to form an
actual movie. So this is what
they're doing with this sort of.
</p>

<p>
This electron. Well yeah.  Electron electron microscope they're
actually moving it with this AFM tip.
</p>

<p>
So again, there, they're changing the voltage on the electron right on
the tip.
</p>

<p>
Such that it will sort of not oxidize an not reduce, but actually
share electrons with the actual Atom. And when it's when it's sharing
electrons with the Atom, it's actually bonded with the Atom and with
if it's bonded with the Atom you could actually move it right? So sort
of glued yourself to that and then you sort of change the voltage and
release the Atom.  And then you can sort of.  What do you call it?
Just kind of move the atoms where you want them informed? This sort of
interface that you want and here they just sort of as to kind of show
off. They just made a movie. Each sort of the pixels is an Atom. Yeah,
so I mean this is relatively old, but so things have moved on, but
these are the kind of things that are actually possible now.

<p>
So there's sort of a hopefully, you know, got an idea of like. Or
maybe some of the things that you might might be able to do with some
of the concepts that you have, but you know a lot of it is just.
Understanding the basic principles behind things and then and
then. It's just sort of being creative in trying to figure out how you
can put those principles together to do something new.
</p>

<p>
So the basic overview of the way the module run is in the first
couple weeks, we're going to be talking about surfaces and interfaces
and sort of like the the mathematical description of those
interfaces. And there were here we're going to be just talking about
interfacial tension, the shapes of kind of interfaces and how that
might be changed. Wetting contact angles, capillary forces, those kind
of things. Then week three, we're going to be talking a bit about
microscopic dynamics, so this is a little bit of a review of.
Classical mechanics and a bit of an intro to quantum mechanics.  So
again, it's not going to be.  I mean, don't worry too much about about
sort of things being really abstracted or not will try to make things
as kind of concrete as possible, but I just want to show you guys you
guys have, you know the the the right background to kind of to be able
to do these things.
</p>

<p>
So surfaces and interfaces again pretty much prevalent everywhere, but
we're going to actually exploit these kind of well. Get a more basic
understanding of how they work.  What what their origin is, how we
quantify them, and then how we can actually use them too for certain
applications.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Yeah, and then so based on these surfaces we can actually do things
like nanofabrication's, so we can actually try to you know, how do we
form these little kind of features on an electronic device? And get
things to kind of organize themselves. In a pattern that we can try to
use, how do we use that kind of thing to get self cleaning surface is
how do we use that kind of thing too?  You know, move things.  Or make
or make kind of self healing materials, for example.

<p>
And so this is the kind of system mechanics is going to be one of the
cornerstones of what you're going to learn in this module. So this
kind of interesting question is, you know, so that you know that
there's like 10 to the 23 you know in in a gram of water, around 10 or
20, three kind of molecules of water. And if you think about all the
different numbers, you have to specify to get the positions and
velocities of every single particle. Every single water molecule in
the system. You just think that you know there's too much
information. How do you know that you have the same sort of bunch of
water than someone else, right? But what's kind of interesting is that
if you think of water from thermodynamics, how many different
parameters you need to specify in order to kind of make sure that you
have the same water in the same state as someone else. And the answer
is like 2 right? You need to know like temperature and pressure or
temperature and density.
</p>

<p>
So how did you actually reduce something that actually is is 10 to the
23 degrees of freedom.  Down to something with just two degrees of
freedom.
</p>

<p>
Alright, and what's sort of interesting is that that's kind of related
to, well, this. This sort of how everything kind of reduces to
Gaussian Statistics.
</p>

<p>
It's also kind of interesting in terms of like when you get huge
numbers of multiple when you have huge numbers of events.  Actually,
things are much more predictable than if you just have single events,
right? So that's why sort of when you're gambling in a casino.  You
know whether you win or lose in a particular day or whatever, is
actually very difficult to kind of predict, right?
</p>

<p>
But the casino always wins 'cause they know very precisely. Given that
you know 1000 people gamble everyday or 10,000 people gamble or
there's 10,000 kind of games going on. They can tell you pretty
precisely how many people are gonna win and how many people going to
lose and what the distribution of that's going to be.
</p>

<p>
And so even though the individual events may be very difficult to. To
determine The actual statistics of them are actually quite
reproducible, and you can actually do a lot to kind of model
that. Yep, next slide, thanks.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
And we're going to apply some of this to absorption and then and so
here we you know, we look at the the language and isotherm where you
actually can absorb only one kind of molecule or onto a particular
absorption site.
</p>

<p>
Or you can look at the BET isotherm where you can have multiple
molecules adsorb onto an adsorption site. So you can have many
molecules adored to adsorption site.
</p>

<p>
And so the best you can do in Langmuir isotherm is to get a monolayer
that all the absorption sites are occupied with the BT isotherm, where
you can get is condensation. So you can get several kind of surface
sites, kind of its orb.  But sometimes that can get that can run away
and all of a sudden you can get an infinite number or huge number of
adsorption sites filled. You know with with molecules.
</p>

<p>
And what I want to say is that that mathematically, it is exactly the
same as the difference between fermions and bosons. So fermions are
like the Langmuir model. Where each absorption site is actually a
state of the possible possible state of the system.
</p>

<p>
So in for fermions only one fermion can occupy a particular state at a
time.  You can't sort of put multiple fermions in the same state.
Both arms, however you can. You can put tons of kind of bosons boson
particles into the same energy state.
</p>

<p>
And so when you get this sort of condensation in the BET, a term that
corresponds to Bose Condensation, where you get all the kind of
particles going into one energy state.  And fermions fermions are like
the language isotherms. An Permian examples of fermions are are kind
of Electrons and that's the kind of system we're going to be looking
at.  Bosons are going to be photons.  We're going to be looking at.
So how do we actually get the statistics? How do they differ between
these two? We're going to be looking at Electrons are fermions and
photons for bosons.
</p>

<p>
And one of the things we're going to do is derive the kind of booty,
call it the black body radiation, sort of formula, and that just is a
consequence of boson statistics. OK, so next slide please.

<p>
So we're going to be looking at Electrons in the end, and all that is
is, is is just knowing that only one electron can enter a state, and
then what actually is going to govern the whole the properties of the
material are kind of what kind of states are are available to the
electrons to occupy.
</p>

<p>
And the big thing there were going to be covering what's known as band
Gap theory.  And all that is there is that there is a, you know, two
sets of energy states. There's what's known as the valence band, which
are the lower energy states.  Then typically there's a huge gap where
there's no states available to the system, and then there's a much
higher sort of set of states available known as the conduction band.
</p>

<p>
And so the whole big game of this thing. Is that?  You're you're kind
of. Electrons are gonna be all in the valence band. And if you have a
huge bandgap that it'll take a large amount of energy to actually get
an electron from the valence band and conduction band, then that
actually corresponds to a an insulator. Next is like if your
electron. If you're kind of your energy gap is very small or
negligible. Actually, then it's very easy for you to go into the
conduction band, and that's what's known as a conductor is just. You
know that electrons can easily. Kind of get out of there kind of
valence band and just start moving around in these available states.
And then you have semiconductors where you just have a gap where it's
you know it's just enough that you kind of thermally can excite things
into that higher level, but but by changing things like temperature or
by kind of using light to promote things, you can actually greatly
enhance. The kind of number of electrons that are conducting in the
system, and you can use that to kind of again build devices.  And if
you go to the next slide.

leads?

<p>
Which are kind of devices that emit light. And the flip side of that.
Photovoltaics devices that absorb light so leads take
electricity. Sorry, take work and convert it into radiation

these? How these different levels work?  How that's related to these
molecular orbitals or atomic orbitals that you might have learned in
high school chemistry or in CP207 in principles of Chemistry.
</p>

<p>
Uh. And um, and will be looking at how we can use that to kind of
catalyze reactions or force reactions that may not have got may not
have gone forward like for, for example, like converting CO2 back to
methane.

Where we can try to kind of get help us use radiation or photons to
try to get these reactions to go back the other direction?

CP535 is a 10 credit module, and nominally, this means that there is a
total time requirement about 100 hours.  Roughly speaking, this can be
broken down into 30 hours of contact time and 70 hours of self-study,
which includes working on the coursework.  This number is only meant
to provide you with a guide for you to plan your studies.
