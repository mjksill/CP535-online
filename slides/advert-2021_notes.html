<p>
Hello, my name is Leo, and this semester I will be delivering the
module CP535: Molecular and Interfacial Science.
</p>

<p>
In this module, we will be covering the fundamentals of phenomena at
interfaces and the processes that occur at the molecular level.  The
aim will be to understand the properties and behavior of materials,
their microscopic origins, and how these can be exploited in
applications.
</p>

<p>
The module will officially start on Monday September 20.  The MyPlace
site is still under construction, so I will be modifying and adding
material during the next few weeks.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions, please feel free to post them in the
discussion forum, and I will be happy to address them.

</p>

<p>
There are a lot of innovations and breakthroughs being made in
materials science and nanotechnology, which have the potential to
radically change many aspects of chemical engineering, such as in
process monitoring, chemical synthesis, and energy storage and
harvesting.
</p>

<p>
One of these advances is the field of digital microfluidics, where
innovations in the miniaturization of electronics can be used to
develop devices where we can precisely coordinate the movement of
small droplets of solutions.  This allows us to transport, mix, react,
or analyze solutions.  This has tremendous potential for applications,
such as in developing a lab-on-a-chip, small on-demand microreactors,
or blood analysis devices.
</p>

<p>
In this module we will gain a better understanding of the electronic
properties of materials and how these can be exploited in
applications, such as for the development of light emitting diodes and
photovoltaic cells.  This will also allow us to understand the basic
working principles behind the creation of self-cleaning surfaces, the
use of sunlight to catalyze reactions such as the splitting of water
into hydrogen and oxygen, and the analysis and manipulation of
chemistry at the molecule level.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, this module will allow you to better relate these
technologies and their implications to your particular interests.
Perhaps, you might be able to incorporate some of these innovations in
your work or possibly even invent and develop your own technologies
based on these ideas.

</p>

<p>
The main topics that will be covered in the module can be divided into four main sections: (i) interfacial science, (ii) microscopic dynamics, (iii) statistical mechanics, and (iv) the electronic properties of materials.
</p>

<p>
Within the interfacial science section of the module, we will discuss how the surface tension of a material originates from the interactions between its constituent molecules.  We will then consider some of the consequences of surface tension, such as dictating the shapes of droplets, the wetting of solid surfaces by liquid drops, capillary forces, and bridging forces.  As part of this, we will also go into a bit of depth on the mathematical description of surfaces and interfaces.
</p>

<p>
Next, we will turn our attention to the dynamics of systems at the microscopic scale.  We will briefly review classical mechanics and introduce some concepts of how we characterize the microscopic state of a systems.  This will then take us to a basic introduction to quantum mechanics.
</p>

<p>
Statistical mechanics provides a connection between microscopic interactions between the molecules that make up a system and its macroscopic behavior, such as its thermodynamic properties.  We will go through some simple examples, including deriving the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution, examining ideal gases, and the studying the adsorption of gases onto surfaces.
</p>

<p>
The final topic applies the basic quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics we learned previously to examine the electronic properties of materials and the use of these properties in applications, such as the creation of LEDs and solar cells and in catalysis.

<p>
As mentioned previously, I will be the lecturer for this module.  The
demonstrator will be Chris Boyle.
</p>

<p>
Lectures and question &amp; answer sessions will be held live on Zoom on
Tuesdays from 2.00 to 3.00 pm.  The Tuesday sessions will mainly be
devoted to covering new material and acting as a question and answer
session.  Detailed notes and recordings of the lectures from the
previous academic year are available on the Myplace site, so you can
make use of these ahead of these sessions.
</p>

<p>
Tutorial sessions will run every week on Fridays from 10.00 to 11.30
am.  Each session will be based around a few questions that will
illustrate concepts covered during the week.  The Friday sessions will
be mainly to review material from the past week or earlier and to
provide help on any tutorial problems or to answer any questions about
the module.
</p>

<p>
In weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, the tutorial sessions will be run on-line
on Zoom, while in weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, they will be held in room
703 of the Graham-Hill Building.
</p>

<p>
Finally, in the last teaching week of the semester, which is week 11,
the lecture and tutorial sessions will be used to provide a review for
module material and preparation for the final examination.
</p>





<p>
Its format will be mainly informal and flexible.  The
tutorial sessions should be used to ask questions if you are having
troubles with any of the tutorial problems or concepts that are
covered in the module.

<p>
A tentative schedule of the lecture materials is shown here.
</p>

<p>
In week 1 we will cover surfaces and interfaces, and in week 2 we will
look more closely at the interfaces between solids and liquids and
gases.
</p>

<p>
In week 3 we cover microscopic dynamics, briefly reviewing classical
mechanics and then getting a basic introduction to quantum mechanics.
</p>

<p>
In week 4 we will start into statistical mechanics and we will look at
an example of its application in week 5 to ideal gases and kinetic
theory.  In week 6, we will look at its specific application to
adsorption, and then in week 7 we will apply statistical mechanics to
quantum systems.  This will then lead us into week 8, where we will
look at the electronic properties of materials, and from there in week
9 we will look at electronic devices like LEDs, photovoltaic cells,
and other devices, if time allows, such as transistors and vacuum
tubes.  Then finally in week 10 we will look at the application of
these concepts into catalysis, specifically electrocatalysis and
photocatalysis.
</p>

<p>
The final week is reserved for a review of the module material and
preparation for the exam.

There is only one component of assessment in this module, which is the
final exam.  The exam paper will consist of three questions that cover
various aspects of the entire content of the module.  The exam
questions will be of a similar style and level of difficulty to the
tutorial problems.  We will discuss more details of the exam during
the final week of the semester.

Materials that will be useful for you to review are shown here.
</p>

<p>
In this module, we will be applying a lot of the chemical engineering
principles that you learned in the previous years to the molecular
scale.  The main focus and illustrative examples that you have
encountered on the course so far have mainly been on "macroscopic"
systems.  In this module, we will be applying balances, kinetics,
statistics, etc. to examine interfaces, molecules, and even electrons.
